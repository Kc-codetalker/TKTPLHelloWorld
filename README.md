Hello World Android App with Java
==
This is my first Android app developed using Java (and Android Studio). This app is just a Basic Activity template (provided by Android Studio) with addition of text input field and Enter button, following [this documentation](https://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/building-ui "Build a simple user interface  |  Android Developers"). The text input field (and Enter button) add a functionality to change "World" in the "Hello World!" text into whatever entered into the field.

Installation

There is currently no APK file in this commit. One will have to clone this repository and run it locally (using Android Studio or other tool).
